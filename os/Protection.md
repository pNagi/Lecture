# Protection

## Outline
+ Goals of Protection
+ Principles of Protection
+ Domain of Protection
+ Access Matrix
+ Implementation of Acess Matrix
+ Access Control
+ Revocation of Acess Rights
+ Capability-Based Systems
+ Language-Based Protection

## Objectives
+ Discuss the goals and principles of protection in a modern computer system
+ Explain how protection domains combined with an `access matrix` used to specify the `resources` a `process` may access
+ Examine capability and _language-based protection_ systems

## Goals of Protection
+ In one protection model, computer consists of a collection of objects, hardware or software
+ Each object has a unique name and can be accessed through a well-defined set of operations
+ Protection problem - ensure that each object is accessed correctly and only be those processes that are allowed to do so

## Principles of Protection
_Privilege: (n.) ข้อได้เปรียบ, เอกสิทธ์, สิทธิพิเศษ_
+ Guilding principle - **principle of least privilege**
 + Programs, users and systems should be given just enough **privileges** to perform their tasks
 + Limits damage if entity has a bug, gets abused
 + Can be static (during life of system, during life of process)
 + Or dynamic (changed by process as needed) - **domain switching, privilege escalation**
 + "Need to know" a similar concept regarding access to data
